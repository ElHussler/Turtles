---DESIGN---
Functional/Technical aspects, Implementation details of:
1) Opponent detection			- Green hat recognition, Searching, Last-known location
						 (TODO: Fix jerky course corrections (buffer img/centroids),
							Only rotate twice (Odom topic?), then Mapping)
2) Obstacle avoidance			- 	 (TODO: DEBUG LASERSCAN)
3) Player behaviour (attack/escape)	- Attack (TODO: LaserScan to stop from hitting prey)
4) "Choice of relevant parameters"	- Linear/Angular Speeds, search rotation amount?
5) Additional functionality		- 	 (TODO: Add functions from 'Extra' section below)

---IMPLEMENTATION---
1) Well-commented and structured code	-	 (TODO: Add adequate comments)

---TESTING---
1) Functionality (efficient implementation)
2) Performance (time/distance accuracy)
3) Limitations
4) Possible improvements
5) Influence of system parameters (Speed, CPU speeds, controller values)

---REPORT---
2500 words covering:
1) Technical Design
	a) Implementation details and relevant parameters for:
		i) Opponent detection (Spatial awareness; reasoning whether to: search vs. pursue, search in last known
		   direction of prey, search on spot first then traverse map, use bumper if to catch prey if visible)
		ii) Obstacle avoidance (Spatial awareness; reasoning whether to: pursue vs. avoid, combine avoidance
		    tactics to prevent endless loops & getting stuck, check previous avoidance attempts)
		iii) Player behaviour (Predator 'Search & Destroy')
2) Testing & Evaluation
	a) Functionality (efficient implementation)
	b) Performance (time/distance accuracy)
	c) Limitations
	d) Possible improvements

---ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY---
1) Advanced object detection
	-Colour-based learning
	-Extra visual cues
	-Multi-object handling
	-Localisation
2) Behaviour coordination
	-Finite State Machine
3) 'Prey' Behaviour
4) Spatial awareness
	-Analysis of hiding places

---DEMONSTRATION---
1) Structured
2) Well-prepared
3) Highlight features

---TO-DO---
1) Implement AND DEBUG LaserScans, add bumper topic
	- Obstacle Avoidance
	- Prevent Predator from hitting prey
?) Limit search rotations to 2 for efficiency
	- Next step is implementing Mapping and traversing blind spots
?) Fix jerky course corrections
	- Set up buffer image of middle columns, if blob is within buffer, don't post Twist message
